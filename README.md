Market Basket Analysis in Python using the Apriori algorithm is a technique used to uncover associations and patterns in a given dataset of transactions, typically in retail settings. It helps identify frequently co-occurring items in customers' shopping baskets, allowing businesses to understand product relationships and make informed decisions, such as product placement, cross-selling, and personalized marketing strategies. The Apriori algorithm efficiently generates association rules based on support, confidence, and lift measures to highlight significant item combinations.
